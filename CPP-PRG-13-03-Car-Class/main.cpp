//  Write a class named Car that has the following member variables:
//
//  * yearModel - an int that holds the car's year model
//  * make - a string that holds the make of the car
//  * speed - an int that holds the car's current speed
//
//  In addition, the class should have the following constructor and other meber functions:
//
//  * Constructor - The constructor should accept the car's year model and make as
//  arguments. These values should be assigned to the object's yearModel and make member
//  variables. The constructor should also assign 0 to the speed member variables.
//  * Accessor - appropriate accessor functions to get the values stored in an object's
//  yearModel, make, and speed member variables.
//  * accelerate - The accelerate function should add 5 to the speed member variable
//  each time it is called.
//  * brake - The brake function should substract 5 from the speed member variable
//  each time it is called.
//
//  Demomstrate the class in a program that creates a Car object, then calls the accelerate
//  function five times. After each call to the accelerate function, get the current speed
//  of the car and display it. Then, call the brake function five times. After each call to the
//  brake function, get the current speed of the car and display it.
